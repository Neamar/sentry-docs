<Expandable title="Are there plans to include the Dev Toolbar in the JavaScript SDK?">

The the Dev Toolbar is very distinct from the JavaScript SDK and will not be merged into the [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript).

Some of the differences include:
  - The toolbar has a different set of [dependencies](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-toolbar/blob/main/package.json) and uses different browser APIs that the JavaScript SDK does not use. For example: the toolbar will interact with things like cookies and local storage. By keeping these pieces of code separate, it is easier to audit the [SDK code on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript) to verify that it is not persisting information inside end-users' browsers.
  - The setup & deploy instruction are very different. The SDK is best deployed on staging and production environments, and can be configured easily with environment variables. The Dev Toolbar requires special considerations to deploy it into production, usually by creating a condition so that it's only included for members of your own Sentry organization. This is why it's important to keep the setup instructions separate between the two.
